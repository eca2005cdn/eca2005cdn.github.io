        <h2>Anyway. Here goes nothing.</h2>
        <p>So. I don't exactly remember how this idea got into my head, but I had just learned how to make a rock, paper, scissors game using Python, and I was assigned to make a game with this sorta function. Where there would be at least 5 variables that interacted uniquely with each other. Hence the idea of a <strong>MUPPETS DATING WEBSITE</strong> popped into existence. (yes. I actually made a dating website for muppets. More on that later.) Or at least, in my head.</p>
        <p>Here's the catch. There's only five muppets (three male, two female), and the chances, like in life, are rigged for certain characters. For example, Beaker won't be able to get a date for a long time. However, Kermit's bound to get Piggy most of the time. But there's still a chance she'll reject him. Oh, and another thing. Anyone can go with anyone, as long as it's a straight relationship. Anyway.</p>
