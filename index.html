        <h2>Anyway. Here goes nothing.</h2>
        <p>So. I don't exactly remember how this idea got into my head, but I had just learned how to make a rock, paper, scissors game using Python, and I was assigned to make a game with this sorta function. Where there would be at least 5 variables that interacted uniquely with each other.</p>
        <p>Hence the idea of a <strong>MUPPETS DATING WEBSITE</strong> popped into existence. (yes. I actually made a dating website for muppets. More on that later.) Or at least, in my head.</p>
        <p>Here's the catch. There's only five muppets (three male, two female), and the chances, like in life, are rigged for certain characters. For example, Beaker won't be able to get a date for a long time. And I didn't want to spend too much time on the project.</p>
